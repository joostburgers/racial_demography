      <div class="index_text">
        <div class="anchor" id="introduction"></div>
        <h2 class="text_title">Introduction</h2>
        <p>The <em>Digital Yoknapatawpha</em> database is a highly curated data set that represents "all" of the locations, characters, and events in Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha fictions. This data can be mapped to gain insight
          into the interactions between different types of characters across the varied spaces of the narratives. These interactions represent a kind of demographic map. This is not a traditional demography. There are, of course, no census records,
          voting rolls, or cadastral surveys of
          Yoknapatawpha that demographers can use to paint a picture of the population. There are, however, a number of data points that can act as proxies for understanding the relationship between characters and locations across the
          corpus. The most intuitive way to display this information is through maps commonly used for population analysis: choropleths and population density "heatmaps." Needless to say, translating information about a fictional text into data that
          is intelligible to a Geographic Information System (GIS) is involved and imperfect. Nevertheless, the resulting maps are highly suggestive of the deep connections Faulkner made between people and places. The following interactive commentary
          documents how the <em>DY</em> data was used to create heatmaps and choropleths of Yoknapatawpha's racial composition, how to read them, what they might mean, and, finally, their limitations.<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup><a class="anchor-return" id="ref1"></a>
        </p>

        <div class="anchor" id="understanding_data"></div>
        <h2 class="text_title">Understanding the Data</h2>
        <p>The data in <em>DY</em> is split across three tables: locations, characters, and, events. Locations and characters denote places and people who are either present or mentioned in the text. Events are the conjunction of locations and
          characters, and represent one continuous action at one location by an individual character or multiple characters during one discrete period of time. Iterating characters over events by location generates a frequency distribution of the
          different types of characters that appear at specific locations. Computationally, joining and iterating the various tables is a simple procedure; deciding what characters are represented at a particular location on a demographic map is a
          far more vexing philosophical question.
        </p>
        <strong>Character Data</strong>
        <p>At its most basic level, demographic mapping relies on counting the absence and presence of particular kinds of people within a specific space, such as: births by country, senior citizen road accident deaths by state, or female votes cast
          by district. Creating
          a demographic map of a fictional world is challenging precisely because characters are not people. Indeed, narratologists have wrestled with the nature of character ontology for some time.<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup><a
            class="anchor-return" id="ref2"></a> For the purpose of mapping characters, there were
          three significant issues that required imperfect editorial solutions that sliced off about 20% of the data.</p>

        <ul class="exceptions-list">
          <li><em>Present</em>
            <!-- [<img src="images/bm-sm-sq.png" class="list-glyph"></a>]  -->
            <em> vs. Mentioned </em>
            <!-- [<img src="images/bm-sm-sq.png" class="list-glyph transparent"></a>]  -->
            - All of the characters on the maps are only those that are present
            at the
            event, and excludes those who are mentioned, even if the mentioned characters might play a significant role in the narrative.</li>
          <li><em>Individual </em> [<img src="images/MRR-sq.png" class="list-glyph"></a>] <em> vs. Group </em> [<img src="images/group_icons_Male_R_icon-sm-sq.png" class="list-glyph"></a>] - There is no consistent way to account for non-countable
            collectives
            like "crowds," "men of Jefferson," or "a couple." All groups were eliminated from the count. </li>
          <li><em>Singular</em> [<img src="images/FWW-sq.png" class="list-glyph"></a>] <em>vs. Plural identities </em>[<img src="images/FWW-sq.png" class="list-glyph"></a><img src="images/mf-sm-sq.png" class="list-glyph"></a><img
              src="images/FWW-sq.png" class="list-glyph"></a>] - In some cases where characters reappear in different texts, Faulkner revises their racial identity. Rather than consolidating them into singular characters, they were left as plural identities.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Location Data</strong>

        <p>Another important consideration is the placement and consolidation of locations on an aggregate map. There are 68 individual maps in <em>DY</em>, each custom-made for a particular text. Some of the texts include locations that are either
          inside or outside of Yoknapatawpha, but feature a large number of events. To solve this problem, the team created custom insets. The benefit of this approach is that it provides a far more granular view into the world of Yoknapatawpha. The
          drawback is that map insets overlap when consolidating the maps. Case in point, the short story "Ad Astra," and the novels, <em>Sanctuary</em> and <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, all have insets in the northeast quadrant of the map,
          but they signify places as far apart as the Western Front, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Oxford, Mississippi. Figures 1-3 show the placement of these insets across the various maps.

        </a>


        <p>
          To rectify this problem, all of the locations outside of Yoknapatawpha were remapped either onto the "region," "nation," or "world" maps. The insets that provide a more detailed view of places within Yoknapatawpha, as for example the
          Compson place in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, were consolidated into one location on the main map. These translations sacrifice some of the detail of the individual maps, but this makes a negligible difference when trying to capture
          population distributions at scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          A more intractable issue is that locations in fiction do not exist independently of the events that occur there. With a demographic map, the statistics describe a specific space, but those statistics do not have an effect on the position
          and boundaries of locations. Put crudely, the map exists before the statistics. What's more, in the real world, natural and man-made features like rivers and roads do not tend to change dramatically over a short span of time. Yet, space in Faulkner's texts does not necessarily abide by these physical rules. For one, the maps do not precede the narratives. Faulkner's did not draw a map of Yoknapatawpha and then plot characters onto it. More importantly, each text shapes its
          locations, as much as it is shaped by them. The <em>DY</em> team has attempted to honor this creative vision by treating each text as its own world with its own map. The result is that some places might be in several different positions on
          the total consolidated map. Likewise, the landscape and the man-made features of the map can also change, thereby placing each location in a new context.
        </p>
        <p>
          The interactive display below was designed to demonstrate how landscape, infrastructure, and location all interact with one another within and across texts. The display allows users to toggle between the maps of different texts: "The Old
          People," "A Justice," and <em>Go Down, Moses</em>. One thing that these texts share is that they all include the blacksmith shop where Sam Fathers works. This location is indicated by the different colored icons. The icons for "The Old
          People" and "A Justice" are close together, and at some remove from the blacksmith on the McCaslin plantation. Superficially, it would appear the blacksmiths for "The Old People" and "A Justice" are more similar to each other than that of
          <em>Go Down, Moses</em>. A careful comparison of the landscape and infrastructure surrounding all three locations reveals that conceptually the blacksmith in "The Old People" and <em>Go Down, Moses</em> share some important similarities
          that set them apart from the one in "A Justice." In "A Justice" the river close to the blacksmith is a tributary of the larger river to the south, in the "Old People" the tributary is connected to the river in the north. In <em>Go Down,
            Moses</em> the blacksmith is still by a tributary from the north, but it runs farther east than the one in the "Old People." The infrastructure also changes. In "A Justice" the blacksmith is along the only road mentioned that leads to
          town. In <em>Go Down, Moses</em> and "The Old People" the blacksmith is on an extensive network of roads. Its connection to the wider world is quite different than the blacksmith in "A Justice." In each case, the location and the way it
          interacts with the surrounding is different. There is no way to determine the "true" position of a location, because it can only be established in the context of the text and in relation to the surrounding landscape and infrastructure.

          <div class="map-container-caption">The map overlays above show how locations can shift from story to story. Beyond changes in their position, Faulkner is also very nuanced about changing the context of each place. In "A Justice" the
            blacksmith shop is relatively isolated, and adjacent to the only road to town. Meanwhile, in <em>Go Down, Moses</em> the shop is one location connected to the wider world via a network of roads.</div>
        </div>

        <p>
          These shifts between maps would create quite a number of challenges if this were a traditional demographic study. For example, one of the most common ways to study populations is by counting the people who live at a particular residence,
          but if, as is the case in <em>DY</em>, the place of residence has multiple possible locations, it would be difficult to determine the number of people living in these residences without knowing the "primary" residence, so to speak. Using
          the <em>DY</em> data it is possible to side-step this hurdle, because a far more powerful piece of information is available: event data. Event data indicates where characters are and when. Thus, rather than only having the home addresses of
          characters, <em>DY</em> has the equivalent of their GPS data on their phone, and can track them throughout Yoknapatawpha. Doing this for all of the characters and breaking them down by a particular attribute, in this case race, indicates
          which types of characters are in the different areas of the map. Importantly, this type of analysis works well across larger areas, but breaks down at the level of individual locations. If, for instance, we wanted to know what kinds of
          people show up at Sam Fathers' blacksmith shop, we would have to consolidate the three individual locations into one shop and put it somewhere on the map. As none of the three shops is the "true" shop, the resulting map would show the
          number of people at an arbitrarily chosen location, which is not very useful for analysis.

        <h2 class="text_title">Literary Cartography and Demographic Maps</h2>

        <p>In demographic mapping, there are two common types of maps: choropleths and heatmaps. Choropleths aggregate the features within a predefined area such as a country, state, or county. Heatmaps show the frequency of a feature across an area.
          Both types of maps tell different stories. In choropleths, the data is shaped by the area. They are good at demonstrating differences between areas, such as state voting results. In heatmaps, the area is generated by the data, and
          highlights differences across space, such as the rate of infection of a disease. The possibility of creating either map is in some measure dependent on the data available. The <em>DY</em> data, which captures where characters are
          interacting and when, is well-suited to heatmaps. With some modification and recoding, the data can also be represented as a choropleth.
        </p>

        <strong>Heatmaps</strong>
        <p>
          In mapping, a heatmap layer is created through a density function that produces features on a color gradient and a pre-defined scaled radius based on the frequency of the variable. In lay terms, this means that as more characters are in one
          space the color gets darker and the area covered gets larger. Without getting into the technical details, the parameters for the interactive map below were set so each heatmap layer was on the same scale and registered any location where
          more than one character occurred. The reason for ignoring locations where only one character ever occurs is that this leads to stippling across the map, which is visually distorting and actually gives these locations more importance than
          they merit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Racial interaction and conflict are two of the most predominant features of Faulkner's fiction. These heatmaps focus on the racial distribution of Faulkner's world, though class, gender, family, and vitality are all different ways to
          think of demography in <em>DY</em>. In the database, there are eight distinct racial attributes a character can have.<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup><a class="anchor-return" id="ref3"></a> Mapping all of these on a heatmap with different
          colors would be visually overwhelming, and therefore all characters who
          were not coded as "white" [<img src="images/FWW-sq.png" class="list-glyph"></a>], "black", [<img src="images/bm-sm-sq.png" class="list-glyph"></a>] or "Indian" [<img src="images/MRR-sq.png" class="list-glyph"></a>] were recoded as having
          "mixed ancestry" [<img src="images/mf-sm-sq.png" class="list-glyph"></a><img src="images/MBR-sq.png" class="list-glyph"></a> <img src="images/MRW-sq.png" class="list-glyph"></a> <img src="images/MixedRWB-sq.png" class="list-glyph"></a><img
            src="images/indet-m-sm-sq.png" class="list-glyph"></a>]. This also includes characters whose race is indeterminable, such as Joe Christmas. These four layers were then overlaid with each other to show
          possible interactions between characters in space. The interactive map below allows users to add and subtract layers to see where the different groups interact with one another.

          <div class="map-container-caption"> The above map shows the racial distribution of the four major categories in the fiction. What is noticeable is the cluster of white characters in Frenchman's Bend, and the more diverse interactions
            between characters
            in the northeast and northwest of the map.</div>
        </div>


        <p>
          What is immediately noticeable on the map is that the different places in Yoknapatawpha have a different racial composition. Directly north of the town are the spaces occupied by the "Indians," and,
          accordingly, they are the site of the most Native American activity. Meanwhile, the areas to the northwest and the northeast of town have more characters of mixed ancestry. These two corners of the map are the sites of two novels that deal
          extensively with race: <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> and <em>Go Down, Moses</em>. It is tempting to suggest that part of the reason why more mixed ancestry characters appear here is because the Sutpen and McCaslin plantations are more isolated
          from town, and the sexual exploitation that led to mixed ancestry children was less likely to be met with public opprobrium. Another reason why the character types are comparatively more diverse in the northwest is because of
          the hunting grounds of the Big Bottom, Sutpen's former plantation. This is where men from different backgrounds come together to engage in the ritual of the hunt in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the locations closer to town, there are relatively fewer characters outside of the white and black binary. The Sartoris and Compson places both maintain strictly segregated households with very few mixed ancestry characters appearing at
          these locations. Likewise, the town of Jefferson may see some interaction between white and
          non-white characters, but the majority of the people who appear here are white. This trend is even more pronounced in Frenchman's Bend, where the majority of the population is white.
        </p>
        <strong>Animated Heatmaps</strong>
        <p>
          While the above map provides a reasonable overview, it is also distorting because it flattens out time. <em>DY</em> captures time in Faulkner in multiple ways, the most salient of which are narrative time and publication date. The events in
          the fiction stretch from Genesis to 1980 in narrative time, though the history of Yoknapatawpha effectively begins in the later 18th century. Simultaneously, the data also represents thirty years of writing. The animation of either
          variable will result in the same map as above, but the way it arrives there is
          different.
          The chronology animation was created by sequencing all events by date order from 1776 to 1961 (note the date at the bottom right corner of the display). The resulting animation is additive. With each new data point that appears the heatmaps for each race will continue to grow. As all the events in
          each text are sequenced according to narrative time, it disregards when the text was written. By collapsing the publication date, it is possible to see how Faulkner consistently mapped different kinds of characters in different types of
          places, and how the action in these places is bound by narrative time.
        </p>

            </video>
          </div>
          <p>
            The animation tells the story of Yoknapatawpha as the county develops from north to south. The Native American events are the first to appear north of the still non-existent town at the end of the 18<sup>th</sup> century. At about
            the same time, there is a smattering of activity at the McCaslin place in the northeast of the county. Then the other great northern plantation, Sutpen's hundred, becomes a hive of activity, followed by the events that transpire at the
            Sartoris plantation during the Civil War. At the turn of the nineteenth century, the contours of Jefferson and the hamlet of Frenchman's Bend become more visible. It is not until the early twentieth century that the Compson estate comes
            into focus.
            More of the action also stretches to the largely white, agrarian hamlet in the southeast. By the end of the First World War, many of the spaces of Yoknapatawpha have already been traversed, and the county gradually becomes more diverse in
            terms of the types of characters who appear, notably those of mixed ancestry. A reverse trend takes place after the Second World War when the predominant characters in events are white, and the narratives shift their attention to
            Frenchman's Bend. Throughout the twentieth century, the narratives also travel to places farther and farther away from Yoknapatawpha. There is more activity west of the Mississippi and there are events that take place on several different
            continents. On the
            whole, the animation underscores the fact that the spaces of Faulkner's map had different imaginative valences.
          </p>

        </div>
        <p>
          The data can also be displayed by publication date. To make this animation, several different techniques were used. First, the texts were ordered by their publication date. In the sequence, the racial heatmaps for each text "blossom" out
          of the map. Below this blossom layer is an additive layer that expands as more texts in the publication sequence are added to the map. In this way, it is possible to keep track of racial heatmaps of a specific
          text in relation to the spaces Faulkner has already described in previous texts.

          <p>
            The publication map tells a similar story to the chronological heatmap. Here, it is not so much chronological time in the narrative that corresponds to an increase of mixed ancestry characters, but publication date. The map gets notably
            more populated with mixed ancestry characters later in Faulkner's career. This is particularly true of texts like <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>, <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, and <em>The Reivers</em>. On the whole though, there are a non-trivial
            number of texts that feature white characters almost exclusively. The Snopes trilogy especially stands out, and there are very few non-white characters who are present at the events in Frenchman's Bend. Nevertheless, the stark contrast
            between the racial maps of texts like <em>Go Down, Moses</em> and The Snopes trilogy should not be seen as an easy short-hand to understanding race in these novels. Instead, they are suggestive of how of Faulkner imaginatively connected
            different types of people with different types of places. </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Heatmaps are a useful tool for understanding the relative density difference across areas of the map. The problem is that it is very hard to determine the orders of magnitude. It is clear that Jefferson has more activity, but
          there is no way to quantify this activity other than the darker shades of the respective colors. One way to quantify differences between areas of a map is through a choropleth.

          <p>As previously noted, choropleths show the relative distribution of features within a specific area. There are two challenges for creating such a map with the <em>DY</em> data. First, Faulkner did not have predefined administrative areas
            on his own maps. True, he does describe different "beats," but the boundaries of these "beats" are not defined in a way that is useful for mapping. Second, a more general problem with choropleths is that it is hard to show population
            distributions for several variables if there is one predominant group. In the case of <em>DY</em>, the number of white characters overshadows the rest of the population, and mapping the characters by race in a choropleth results in any
            non-white characters barely registering on the map. One way to circumvent both of these issues is to manually create administrative areas based on thematic connections, and then render the statistics for each area as a chart. This is a
            visually cruder method, but provides more detailed insight into the areas. All eight race types can be represented, and it is easier to visually distinguish relative proportions. The drawback is that there is no way to animate this layer
            without causing a highly disjunctive experience for the viewer. The effect would be one where thirteen pie charts simultaneously change their relative proportions over time!
          </p>

          <p>
            The choropleth (figure 4) bears out in more granular detail what the above heatmaps already showed more intuitively. The predominant group in Yoknapatawpha is white. The more north Faulkner's imagination travels, the higher the
            possibility of different types of characters increases. The more densely populated centers such as Jefferson and Frenchman's Bend appear to offer a check on any type of transgression of Jim Crow social codes and laws. In similar fashion,
            the wider world also has fewer non-white characters. The curious exception is the breakdown at the regional scale. This is actually one of the more diverse areas of the fiction. In particular, Memphis, which often acts as a transgressive
            antipode to
            Jefferson's strict social codes, has people from different racial categories interacting with one another. The statistics for each chart are also available in figure 5.

        </div>

        <div class="anchor" id="conclusions"></div>
        <h2 class="text_title">Cautions and Conclusions</h2>
        <p>Heatmaps and choropleths are incredibly powerful tools to describe space at scale. Their power can also have a distorting effect. Few elections are complete without cartographers reminding the public and pundits that just because a
          district, county, state, or country voted in a particular way, does not mean everyone in that space monolithically shares those beliefs. Much the same, viewing spatialized aggregations of <em>DY</em> data reveals the contours of life in
          Faulkner's fiction, but simultaneously obscures an individual character's experience. Fiction, after all, does not operate on the level of the general, but lives in the particular. These maps are best viewed as the context in which
          Faulkner's fiction transpires. They cannot begin to describe the nuanced, complex, and sometimes explosive, inter-racial interactions that mark so much of his writing. Nonetheless, they give a sense as to why those events play out the way
          they do in one place versus another.
        </p>
        <p>The maps also provide a larger insight into the world of the Jim Crow South. The legal apartheid regime that was in place in the South before the Civil Rights movement was uniformly dehumanizing to non-whites, but - based on Faulkner's
          telling - this dehumanization was not uniformly experienced. Race also had a spatial component. The areas with the highest population density, Jefferson and Frenchman's Bend, are more segregated and whiter than the more sparsely populated,
          rural areas around Sutpen, McCaslin, and the Chickasaw lands. It is no coincidence that two of these locations are also the sites of former plantations. As a moderate white desegregationist, Faulkner believed that the South's original sin
          of slavery could only be expatiated by the Southern community coming together through the mutual recognition of a shared history as it does in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>.
          In this sense, Yoknapatawpha's uneven demography hints at a possible future demographic mosaic that is always yet to come, even if Faulkner himself might have been unclear on how to get there.
